# Comprise
An Android UI experiment inspired by Jetpack Compose, Flutter and WPF

The idea is as follows:

 - Use Kotlin, but no Compose magic
 - Very simple views
 - Measure, layout and draw on Canvas as usual
 - Reuse standard resource system
 - XML?

Views ideally should support everything the current view system does.
